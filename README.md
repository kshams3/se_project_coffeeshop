# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. I worked very hard to put together all the differnt files and create the main structure from scratch for the first time.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I plan on creating a better looking website and maybe even implement into my portfolio. I would like for the Website to be more coherent with the subject matter rather than just being about plain out coffee. I would also like to us nice artworks on the page to make it more visually appealing to its viewers. More styling and features and also add a variety of sections and categories to make it very organized.
